/*
 * The functor is an object that can be applied to a design to
 * transform it. This is different from the target_t, which can only
 * scan the design but not transform it in any way.
 *
 * When a functor it scanning a process, signal or node, the functor
 * is free to manipulate the list by deleting items, including the
 * node being scanned. The Design class scanner knows how to handle
 * the situation. However, if objects are added to the netlist, there
 * is no guarantee that object will be scanned unless the functor is
 * rerun.
