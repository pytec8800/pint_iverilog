This file describes the build procedure under cygwin32 (Windows 95/98/NT/2K)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: Icarus Verilog also compiles to native Windows binaries if you
use the instructions in the mingw.txt file. Some people prefer cygwin
binaries, and these instructions apply.


To build using cygwin:

Prerequisites:

 o Latest net release (1.1.4) of cygwin (sources.redhat.com/cygwin)

Procedure:
 o Get the source code - see the main Icarus Verilog page for how to
   do this
 o cd to the verilog directory
 o autoconf.sh
 o ./configure
 o make
 o make install

That's all that's needed.

To build your own extensions - just include vpi_user.h and link with
a command like this:

 $(CC) -shared -o <dllname> <objects> -Wl,--enable-auto-image-base -L../vvm -lvvm -lvpip
