 /*
  *  Here we have the canonical "Hello, World" program written in Verilog,
  *  with VPI. It uses the hello_vpi.vpi module that is compiled from
  *  the hello_vpi.c program also in this directory. See the
  *  hello_vpi.c for instructions on how to compile it.
  *
  *  Compile this program with the command:
  *
  *      iverilog -ohello_vpi hello_vpi.vl
  *
  *  After churning for a little while, the program will create the output
  *  file "hello" which is compiled, linked and ready to run. Run this
  *  program like so:
  *
  *      vvp -M. -mhello_vpi hello_vpi
  *
  *  and the program will print the message to its output. Easy! For
  *  more on how to make the iverilog command work, see the iverilog
  *  manual page.
