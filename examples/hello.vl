 /*
  *  Here we have the canonical "Hello, World" program written in Verilog.
  *  We simply print to the program output a simple message. This example
  *  demonstrates the process of compiling and executing a program with
  *  Icarus Verilog.
  *
  *  Compile this program with the command:
  *
  *      iverilog -ohello hello.vl
  *
  *  After churning for a little while, the program will create the output
  *  file "hello" which is compiled, linked and ready to run. Run this
  *  program like so:
  *
  *      vvp hello
  *
  *  and the program will print the message to its output. Easy! For
  *  more on how to make the iverilog command work, see the iverilog
  *  manual page.
