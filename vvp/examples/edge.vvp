; This example tests the operation of a simple posedge event. The module
; that would generate code like this would be:
;
;    module main;
;       reg a;
;
;       initial begin
;          a = 0;
;          #1 a = 1;
;       end
;
;       always @(posedge a) $display("Got a posedge.");
;
;    endmodule


main	.scope module, "main" "main" 0 0;

V_main.a	.var "a", 0 0;
V_main.b	.event posedge, V_main.a;

code	%pushi/vec4 0, 0, 1;
	%store/vec4 V_main.a, 0, 1;
	%delay 1, 0;
	%pushi/vec4 1, 0, 1;
	%store/vec4 V_main.a, 0, 1;
	%end;
	.thread	code;
