/*
 * The vvp_fun_bufif functor implements the logic of bufif0/1 and
 * notif0/1 gates. Input 0 is the value to be buffered, and input 1 is
 * the enable. The gate processes vectors as bit slices handled by an
 * array of gates.
 *
 * The output from the gate is a vvp_vector8_t. The gate adds
 * strengths to the buffered value, and sends H/L in response to
 * unknown enable bits.
