 * The vvp_udp_async_s instance represents a *definition* of a
 * primitive. netlist instances refer to these definitions.
 *
 * The ports argument of the constructor is the number of input ports
 * to the device. The single output port is not counted. The port
 * count must be greater than 0.
 *
 * A level sensitive UDP has a table that includes all the rows that
 * generate a 0 output and another table that includes all the rows
 * that generate a 1 output. A set of inputs is tested against the
 * entries in both sets, and if there are no matches, the output is
 * set to x.
 *
 * The levels0 and levels1 tables are each an array of levels
 * tables. Each levels table is a mask of positions that are supposed
 * to be 0, 1 and x. The LSB of each mask represents first port, and
 * so on. If the bit is set in mask0, a bit4_0 is expected at that
 * position, and similarly for mask1 and maskx. Only exactly 1 bit
 * will be set in the three masks for each bit position.
 *
 * This table structure implies that the number of inputs to the level
 * sensitive device is limited to the number of bits in an unsigned
 * long.
 *
 * The array of strings passed to the compile_table method of a
 * combinational UDP are strings of port_count()+1 characters. The
 * expected inputs are in the order of the UDP inputs, and the output
 * is the last character. For example, an AND gate has these strings
 * passed to the compile_table function:
 *
 *    000   (Both inputs are 0)
 *    010   (Second input is a 1)
 *    100
 *    111   (All inputs are 1, so generate a 1 output)
 *
 * The characters allowed in the input positions are:
 *
 *   0  -- Expect a 0
 *   1  -- Expect a 1
 *   x  -- Expect an x or z
 *   b  -- 0 or 1
 *   l  -- 0 or x
 *   h  -- x or 1
 *   ?  -- 0, x or 1
 *
 * Only 0, 1 and x characters are allowed in the output position.

 * udp sequential devices are a little more complex in that they have
 * an additional output type: no-change. They also have, in addition
 * to a table of levels, a table of edges that are similar to levels
 * but one of the positions has an edge value.
 *
 * The port_count() for the device is the number of inputs. Sequential
 * devices have an additional phantom port that is the current output
 * value. This implies that the maximum port count for sequential
 * devices is 1 less than for combinational.
 *
 * The input table that is passed to the compile_table method is very
 * similar to that for the combinational UDP. The differences are that
 * there is one extra entry in the beginning of each input row that is
 * the current output, and there are more characters accepted at each
 * bit position.
 *
 * The current output bit may contain the same characters as a
 * combinational UDP input position. No edges.
 *
 * The next output position takes the possible values 0, x, 1 and -.
 *
 * The input bit positions take the combinational input characters,
 * plus edge specification characters. Only one input of a row may
 * have an edge input.
 *
 * The edges_table is similar to the levels, table, with the mask?
 * bits having the same meaning as with the levels tables. The edge_*
 * members specify the edge for a single bit position. In this case,
 * the edge_mask* members give the mask of source bits for that
 * position, and the edge_position the bit that has shifted. In the
 * edge case, the mask* members give the final position and the
 * edge_mask* bits the initial position of the bit.
