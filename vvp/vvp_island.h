/*
* Islands are mutually connected bidirectional meshes that have a
* discipline other than the implicit ddiscipline of the rest of the
* run time.
*
* In the vvp input, an island is created with this record:
*
*    <label> .island ;
*
* The <label> is the name given to the island. Records after this
* build up the contents of the island. Ports are created like this:
*
*    <label> .port <island>, <src> ;
*    <label> .import <island>, <src> ;
*    <label> .export <island> ;
*
* The .port, .import and .export records create I/O, input and output
* ports. The <label> is the name that branches within the island can
* use to link to the port, and the <island> is the label for the
* island. The input and I/O ports have a <src> label that links to the
* source net from the ddiscrete domain.
*
* Branches within the island may only reference labels within the
* island. This keeps the nets of the ocean of digital away from the
* branches of analog within the island.
