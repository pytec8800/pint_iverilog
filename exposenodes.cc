/*
 * The exposenodes functor is primarily provided for use by the vlog95
 * target. To implement some LPM objects, it needs to take a bit or part
 * of one of the LPM inputs. If that input is not connected to a real
 * net in the design, we need to create a net at that point so that
 * there is something to which we can apply a bit or part select. This
 * has the effect of splitting the synthesised structure at that point.
 * Rather than creating a new net, we just look for a temporary net
 * created by the synthesis process (there should be at least one) and
 * reset its "local" flag. We also prepend another '_' to the synthetic
 * name to avoid name collisions when we recompile the vlog95 output
 * (because NetScope::local_symbol() doesn't actually check that the
 * name it generates is unique).
